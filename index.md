We're a group of developers, GIS specialists, designers, and geographers all gathering under one roof in the name of maps. CUGOS is the official Cascadia chapter of OSGeo. We are active in the spatial community because we believe in the power maps and data hold, and enjoy exploring their interaction from every perspective.

We [meet regularly](/meetings) on the third wednesday of every month and irregularly on Thursdays at different locations. If you're interested in participating in our community, join the [Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cugos) and please send a message to <em>hello@cugos.org</em>. CUGOS has its own IRC channel hosted on [Freenode](https://freenode.net/). You can connect to our channel <strong>#cugos</strong>. If you're new to IRC, there's a [neat web client](http://webchat.freenode.net/) so you don't have to download any software.

Apart from general chitter chatter on our IRC channel, you can find more substantial posts and tid-bits at our Google group, [Cascadia Users of Geospatial Open Source](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cugos). Here you'll find questions about projects, conference updates, sidecar meetings, and job postings.
