    title: "Doing Spatial Binning Right in a Projected World"
    description: "Spatial binning, like hexbin maps, is a great way to aggregate dense datasets.  However, non-equal area map projections present an interesting challenge, particularly for web maps using Web Mercator (which is what just about every tile map server is going to give you).   In this presentation I discuss a method for identifying “safe zones” to minimize binning problems in Web Mercator.  Don’t let bad hexbins happen to your good data"

    title: "Analyzing Geospatial Patterns Derived from Mobile Ad Bid Data"
    description: "A variety of new technologies related to health, city planning, and commerce, etc. rely on human location data from large swaths of the population. A tempting source is location data sent from mobile phones when in-app or mobile web advertising space on the device is sent to ad exchanges for bidding. These \"bid-call\" locations have significant limitations. I will examine how geospatial patterns reveal these limitations in this presentation"

    description: "While acting as the World Design Capital in 2014, Cape Town published its first open data sets online. A number of Non-Governmental Organizations are acting as advocates and activists with code exchanges for tracking civic issues and data journalism sprints, while other organizations have been making strides to use open data as a participatory realization of open government. In Cape Town, inclusive hackathons are called “Easter Egg Hunts” and are held while the public helps with open data collection through participatory mapping in informal settings. These and other exciting examples of open data in a developing world context will be shared"

    title: Categorizing Districts in the Browser Thanks to Vector Tiles
    description: "I'll talk about Empower Engine's newest product, our district categorizer.  Users can make a map showing stakeholders which races are targeted; an organizer can track which precincts they've sent people to canvass, and when the data has been entered; and the campaign manager can define which districts each organizer should be in charge of.  Dynamically colorizing maps requires vector tiles.  I'll demo the system, talk about some of the technical challenges we faced and show how we surmounted them."

The CUGOS Spring Fling is a **full day event centered around open source geo**. This is an intensely educational session for practitioners of all things open-source geospatial. If you care about geometry busting workflows, brain dumping academic research, parsing vertices while flying drones, code as well as content, usability through design, then show up and eat free food! Join us for this special all-day-kinda event at the magical University of Washington in Seattle.

Our number one goal is to make the Spring Fling a welcoming event for everybody. Please take a moment to read over the [CUGOS code of conduct](/code-of-conduct).

**Location**: The fling will be hosted at the University of Washington, Forest Club Room 207 in Anderson Hall. It's the room with the elk in it. [[campus map](http://uw.edu/maps/?and)]

**Schedule**: The first half of the day is a combination of 20 minute talks and lightening talks. The afternoon will have a number of workshops for beginner and advanced users.

**Transportation & Parking**: Parking on campus is limited. Check out the [UW parking page](https://www.washington.edu/facilities/transportation/parking-daily-visitor) for more information. Check out the newly opened light rail station just south of Anderson Hall at Huskey stadium - a perfect way to get to campus from downtown.

**Contact**: Send us a message [hello@cugos.org](mailto:hello@cugos.org) to get in touch. Hit us up on twitter [@cugosorg](https://twitter.com/cugosorg)!
