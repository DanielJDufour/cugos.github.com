This is a great way to learn about new mapping software, hear how companies are integrating location into their products, and get some hands-on experience with important tools like Leaflet, Turf.js, QGIS, and PostGIS. We welcome all students, professionals, map lovers, coders, and anyone with a passion for learning about spatial information. The Fall Fling is designed for anyone with an interest in maps and open source software."
