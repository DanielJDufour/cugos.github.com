**[Ariel Kadouri](https://arielsartistry.com/)** will talk about the [#30DayMapChallenge](https://twitter.com/hashtag/30DayMapChallenge), and how I made nearly a map a day until day 17.

**[Peter Keum](https://pkgeo.com/)** will talk about WA State Parcel Viewer using data from [WA GIS Portal](http://geo.wa.gov/). I'll talk about various open source tools (GDAL, QGIS, Tippecanoe etc..) to convert, assemble, create, and deploy this web app. I'll share the draft web map link at the meeting. (20 min)

Michael Patrick, who is a long time member of CUGOS, will share his experience of mentoring a graduate CS class tasked to build a project for a  non-profit group via Democracy Lab. (30 min)

**Dustin Carlino** will brainstorm how recent advancements in [A/B Street](https://abstreet.org)'s infrastructure could be used for other OpenStreetMap-based tools. Ideas include a city "bug tracker", a restaurant menu search using open data, and an OSM viewer making node/way inspection easier. This is a brainstorming / discussion session. (20 min)
