## Notes

### Derek

Derek, CUGOS member at large, has been working at a JFO (Joint Field Office) in Orlando.

It's an Arc shop. It's Federal policy not to use Open Source Software due to PII restrictions. Survey 123 to collect data in the field. They do shelter and hotel depopulation to get people in permanent housing solutions.

He's in the Reporting and Analytics division. They do trends and projections. Derek spends a lot of time in the field. Irma, Harvey, Maria and CA wildfires. They're working on all of them. They spend a lot of time trying to get people housing.

Started in Orlando. Lots of debris piles. Most of the worst damage was in the Keys. Survivors are prioritized over Federal personnel, which can create a staffing challenge. A lot FEMA personnel end up on ships, 8 hour shifts in the bed.

Individual Assistance and Public Assistance are the two big categories of disaster recovery. IA gives assistance directly to survivors, PA helps rebuild community infrastructure. PA can last for many years, IA is over generally after 18 months.

Local Hires are heavily relied on for long term recovery operations.

They have a lot of imagery but no way to process it quickly. So, in theory, if someone were to process that to put it on a map, then you could leverage that data to quantify the damage.
