Loose agenda:
=============
- **[Jon Culver](https://github.com/bahoo)** is working on a project called [Bern Advisory](http://bernadvisory.org/) to explain the caucus process to voters in Washington, and other states. It's is an intersection of technology and government data and politics, and being green to both GIS and active involvement in politics, and already it's been a learning experience. Tools include GeoDjango, PostGIS, and Leaflet.
- **[Derek Huling](http://github.com/dhuling)** will demonstrate a novel method developed to stratify terrain models with raster data and cluster analysis.
- **[@bitnerd](https://twitter.com/bitnerd)** geo-person extraordinaire is in town from MSP and will delight the CUGOS crowd with recent FOSS projects.
- **[@kvonkrusenstiern](https://github.com/kvonkrusenstiern)** will share her recent experiences aboard NOAA's research vessel the Okeanos Explorer, the only federally funded ship dedicated to ocean exploration and seafloor mapping.
- **[@you](http://cugos.org/people/)** tell us about what you're trying to solve.


Notes:

--------------------------------------------------------

**[Jon Culver](https://github.com/bahoo)** 

Created the BERN ADVISORY

Talking about the election process

Washington Primary

- Somewhat useless... ballots are sent in and not used

Caucus is the process to select dem nom in wash

- Rule guide is 57 pages ... almost designed to keep people from participating

bernadvisory.org was born

Get where your caucus will be... and much more

How do caucus's work?

- Gather in a location near where you live
- Split up into candidate groups

Tech used:

Django/Requests/Leaflet/PostGIS

Geocoding with Google Maps

--------------------------------------------------------

**[Derek Huling](http://github.com/dhuling)**

Western Washington Univerity - Masters Program

Talking about aspect... how it is derived and tools used to process

Wizard island in crater lake was the case study area

RGB Transformation

The display is only one utility... it actually makes analysis more dynamic

Using Spectral Python

[https://github.com/spectralpython](https://github.com/spectralpython)

Base data (in this example) is a LIDAR dataset

(More pointers to data and work to follow)

--------------------------------------------------------

**[@bitnerd](https://twitter.com/bitnerd)**

Lots of custom iD editor stuff

[https://github.com/missinglinkmaps/custom_id](https://github.com/missinglinkmaps/custom_id)

Talked about FOSS4G conferences (NA and International)

[https://2016.foss4g-na.org/](https://2016.foss4g-na.org/)

Kate was showing KILLER pictures of her adventures on the mapping ship!

Okeanos Explorer - NOAA

240ft - Large vessel and only one doing sea floor mapping

Big uplink so data is updated in near realtime

~$100k/day to operate

3 onboard sonars (running all 3 full 24/7) (turn off for whales, mexico, and bad weather)

- 1 focused on seafloor (300m swath)
- 1 focused on sub-surface
- 1 focused on water column

The sonars have to be callibrated (every 6 hours)

She had the 2am shift!

Job was to process the data (clean up edges and noise)

Took a cool tour in Google Earth of the trackline of the trip

Cool features like seamounts
