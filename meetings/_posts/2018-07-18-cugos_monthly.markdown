## Agenda
- **[@eldang](https://eldang.xyz/)** will talk about [generating](https://github.com/eldang/textgen-all-the-places) fictional English place names.
- **[@jmt2080ad](https://github.com/jmt2080ad/)** will talk about two short unrelated topics: tiling window managers and the `data.table` library in R. Tiling window managers offer fast automatic ways of organizing windows from key commands instead of using the mouse. `data.table` offers fast tabular data operations, both in how we type the operations and how the operations are run. Jason will talk about one example of `data.table` syntax that is very concise and powerful, but a bit confusing at first.  
**[@you](http://cugos.org/people/)** tell us about something cool you are working on
