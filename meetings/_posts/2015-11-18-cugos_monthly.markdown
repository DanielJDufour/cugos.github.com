Loose agenda:
=============
- **[@keum](https://github.com/keum)** This talk will summarize **[KC/SPU CSO Status Viewer](http://www.kingcounty.gov/services/environment/wastewater/cso-status.aspx)** that was built using github,python,geojson, and leaflet with great help from many of CUGOS members. [Slides Here](http://slides.com/keump/deck-13) 
- **[Derek Huling](https://github.com/dhuling)** of Western Washington University briefly talks about the [GeoPy](https://github.com/geopy/geopy) - python library for batch geocoding using popular geocoder APIs.
- Jon Culver is working on a project called [Bern Advisory](http://bernadvisory.org/) to explain the caucus process to voters in Washington, and other states. It's is an intersection of technology and government data and politics, and being green to both GIS and active involvement in politics, and already it's been a learning experience. Tools include GeoDjango, PostGIS, and Leaflet.
- Karsten Vennemann [www.terragis.net](www.terragis.net) and Matt Stevenson [www.coregis.net](www.coregis.net) will give a comprehensive project overview ( 45 minutes plus) on GIS support of the [Collaborative Crop Research Project](www.ccrp.org) . CCRP has 120 agricultural research projects in 12 countries [http://www.ccrp.org/projects](http://www.ccrp.org/projects) aiming at improving livelihoods of small hold farmers through agro-ecological intensification. GIS support for CCRP uses all open source tools (for the 9 African countries) and we will summarize how open sources tools are used to help the projects and target to make their research more efficient. The project tasks range from capacity building and on site GIS training, to direct support of research projects (on demand GIS services), to data collection and manipulation, making data available to researchers in easy to use formats, and creating a suitable Server architecture to support web mapping and storage of research results in data bases. Specific challenges working in developing countries will be highlighted . OS tools used include QGIS, Grass, GeoServer, MapServer, PostGIS, GDAL/OGR, OpenLayers, Leaflet, and less known tools such as GeoClim, Homologue.
- **[@you](http://cugos.org/people/)** tell us about what you're trying to solve.
