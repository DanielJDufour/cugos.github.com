Loose agenda:
=============
- **Sarah Battersby** will explore the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) and discuss some work she's doing related to food deserts and how the USDA creates population grids. She'll then lead a group think session to find a good way to run a Monte Carlo simulation to get a bunch of data.
- **[mapsam](https://github.com/mapsam)** phones in from the Bay Area to demo the latest developments on [dropchop.io](http://dropchop.io/)! Come learn more about how this tool is redefining "GIS in the browser".
- **[@you](http://cugos.org/people/)** tell us about what you're trying to solve.
