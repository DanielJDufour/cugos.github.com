## Agenda
- **[@you](http://cugos.org/people/)** tell us about what you're trying to solve.

- **[Ariel](https://github.com/akadouri)** Will update CUGOS on the [UW Geography Hackathon](https://maphacks.github.io/) and talk a little (and seek advice) about the project he's been working on that involes combining a bunch of datasets to create a financial inclusion map/dashboard of Nigeria. 

- ** [Catherine Kuhn](http://www.thebutmanlab.com/catherine-kuhn/) Will talk about her startup mapping historical flood data using MODIS data and Google Earth Engine.

- **[Ryan](https://github.com/foundatron)** Will bring a bunch of electronic stuff that he's giving away to make room for a new baby. Everything you need to start your next hack project: network routers, network switches, sensors, gps devices, raspberry pi, an old laptop, cables of all types and more.

## Notes

Ariel presented on UW Map Hackathon.   It will be April 28th and 29th in Denny 303 at University of Washington.  You can visit the MapHacks website at [https://maphacks.github.io](https://maphacks.github.io).  They are looking for teachers to present workshops.  If interested, contact Ariel.  

Ariel has his first Real GIS Job.  He used to be an Android programmer.  He will be pulling in data from many financial organizations and start mapping risk in Nigeria.  The project is for BFA, CBN, NIBSS and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  The output will be an Atlas and digital Dashboard.  He imported all the various data sources into a PostgreSQL database and built maps that visualized access to banks using QGIS.  One of the challenges he faced was that place names in Nigeria had many different spellings, so joining data was difficult.
*Special Note: **[Ariel's](https://github.com/akadouri)** is graduating at the end of the quarter.  Congratulations!

[Catherine Kuhn](http://www.thebutmanlab.com/catherine-kuhn/) is a ph.D candidate at UW.  She does a lot of sattelite remote sensing of water.  She and her team are building remotely sensed flood maps for a newly found startup.  They are working with the Dartmouth flood repository.  Historical data includes dates and locations of floods.  Often contains polygons and newspaper articles.  They are building maps of these historic floods using MODIS satellite data.  They are using Google Earth Engine.  They now have a database of 5000 mapped database.  They are QA/QCing the data.  They have a team of 6 and have checked about 600 of the floods.  She is reaching out to the community to look for help reviewing the data.  Thinking about having a hackathon.  Please contact her if you would like to help.


Ryan is looking for GIS data on where you can legally fish in Washington state.  The paper pamphlet is very long and confusing and he would like to make a map to simplify identifying areas where you can legally fish.  Ryan also gave away lots of old gear.
