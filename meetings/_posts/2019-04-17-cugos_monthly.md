## Agenda

**Kate Leroux** Have you ever wondered what goes into designing a map? In this example-packed talk, I will take you ‘under the hood’ of the a map style. You’ll leave with a better understanding of cartographic decision-making, including necessary trade-offs and the logical framework underneath seemingly simple style choices.

**[@you](http://cugos.org/people/)** Introduce yourself! Or re-introuduce yourself! Please tell us about something cool you are working on
