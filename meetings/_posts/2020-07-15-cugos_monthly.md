**Kate von Krusensteirn** will present on her recent work mapping the full depth profile of the Challenger Basin of the Marianas Trench.  In addition to mapping the basin with sonar, she sent multiple depth sensors down to the bottom of the trench to get ground truth XYZ depths.  This is the first time such a complete depth evaluation has been done of the deepest part of the ocean.
