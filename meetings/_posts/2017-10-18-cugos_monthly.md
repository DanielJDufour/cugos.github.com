## Agenda
- **[@powersa](https://github.com/powersa)** walks through some scripts he wrote over the summer to import [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/) (Google Transit Feed Specification) data into a graph database ([neo4j](https://neo4j.com/)) to analyze accessibility to the [Rainier Valley Food Bank](http://www.rvfb.org/) via public transit. He'll discuss some pros and cons of modeling transit networks as graphs and an optimization or two that helped along the way.
- **[@you](http://cugos.org/people/)** tell us about what you're trying to solve.


## Notes

Ye olde conversation about goings on. If anyone is interested in helping out - let us know!
