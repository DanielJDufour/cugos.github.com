## Agenda
- **[@powersa](https://github.com/powersa)** walks through some scripts he wrote over the summer to import [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/) (Google Transit Feed Specification) data into a graph database ([neo4j](https://neo4j.com/)) to analyze accessibility to the [Rainier Valley Food Bank](http://www.rvfb.org/) via public transit. He'll discuss some pros and cons of modeling transit networks as graphs and an optimization or two that helped along the way.
- **[Ethan Sorrelgreen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethansorrelgreen/)** will talk about how Seattle startup [CARMERA](http://www.carmera.com/) is leveraging delivery fleets to create real-time maps of urban environments. He will cover everything CARMERA's data collection methodologies, and how to use machine vision pipelines to extract street-level intelligence and build living maps to power Autonomous Vehicles. 
- **[Ariel Kadouri](https://github.com/akadouri)** pitches early stage planning of a geospatial hackathon. With support of the UW Geography department (and hopefully you), he's begining to organize a geo-themed hackathaton aimed at placing undergrads in the wonderful world of geospatial (and open) software. 
- **[@you](http://cugos.org/people/)** tell us about what you're trying to solve.
