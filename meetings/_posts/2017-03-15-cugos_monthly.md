## Agenda

- "You, Me, and JSONB" from [ARSimmons](https://github.com/ARSimmons)... I will talk (briefly) about some performance gains and optimizations that I discovered by using JSONB with PostgreSQL. I will show some (boring) legacy SQL functions that I cast into the JSONB format and created laser fast returns. Think geriatric Terminator getting a facelift and starring in (yet another) sequel. JSONB + your bad, slow code = "I WILL BE BACK". 
- Amy Hutchins - [Unearth](http://www.unearthlabs.com/): Using drones to build collaboration in construction
- Carson Dietz Hartmann is a Research Analyst at the National Trust for Historic Preservation's Preservation Green Lab. The Green Lab aims to link economic, social and environmental sustainability to the work of reusing and preserving old buildings across the nation. Carson will present on the [Atlas of ReUrbanism](http://forum.savingplaces.org/act/pgl/atlas), the most recent project of the Green Lab.
- [Andrew Powers](https://github.com/powersa) took a crack at importing transportation data into [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) and shares the results in this informal discussion of graph databases and infrastructure.
