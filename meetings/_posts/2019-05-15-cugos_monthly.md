## Agenda

**[@powersa](https://github.com/powersa)** & **[@akadouri](https://github.com/akadouri)** will provide a recap of their recent trip to San Diego, where they ate too many tacos and attended [FOSS4G-NA 2019](https://2019.foss4g-na.org/).

**[Atlas of the PNW:](http://pnwatlas.oregonstate.edu/#/)** **[Gareth Baldrica-Franklin](baldricg@oregonstate.edu)** of Oregon State University will be discussing the background and creation of the 2018/2019 Atlas of the Pacific Northwest, a project created entirely using open source data, software, and code, and designed for education and use by the geographically curious.

**[@flott](https://github.com/flott)** will talk about [some tools](https://github.com/flott/kingco-opengeodata) for downloading data from King County's GIS Data Hub and doing batch conversions from Esri File Geodatabase to GeoPackage or PostgreSQL/PostGIS.

**[@dabreegster](https://github.com/dabreegster)** will give a demo of [A/B Street](https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/blob/master/docs/articles/features/article.md), a traffic simulation game set in Seattle, and describe ongoing work with it.

**Clinton Stipek** With seagrass populations declining worldwide, more research is needed to understand their population dynamics. This project utilized ArcGIS, R, and python to analyze and create projections for different size-based seagrass populations in a study area adjacent to a major city (Miami) using a landscape approach. 

**[@you](http://cugos.org/people/)** Introduce yourself! Or re-introuduce yourself! Please tell us about something cool you are working on

## Meeting notes

**Clinton Stipek** presented [this great story map](https://umiami.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=0dd94072a97d4bd7b4715aa28072c508) on his research.

**Garteh** showed off http://pnwatlas.oregonstate.edu remotely. The project started in the 1950s as a print publication, and was revived in the last couple years as a webiste. Built using tools like Vue and Leaflet, it brings a modern web-based approach to the regional atlas. 

**Ariel and Andrew** went to [FOSS4G-NA](https://twitter.com/akadouri/status/1118365772248522753) and typed up some notes you can find [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m1MwV3ACJnJw1tJaah_zXm3c1s5QL4Zv2ETwnzMxnec/edit?usp=sharing). 

**Fred** presented the motivations and creation of https://github.com/flott/kingco-opengeodata, a tool for bulk conversion and updating copies of KC GIs open data. It's a wrapper for ogr2ogr, and supports FileGDB to GeoPackage or PostGIS. The project also includes a list of the 590 public datasets with links to their metadata. Fun feature: being able to download everything, or download by KC themes. 

**[@dabreegster](https://github.com/dabreegster)** will gave a great demo of [A/B Street](https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/blob/master/docs/articles/features/article.md) a traffic simulator built in Rust.
