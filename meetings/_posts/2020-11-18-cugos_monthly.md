**Mark Rankin and Adrienne Shumlich:** Ocean Networks Canada (ONC) supports tsunami resilience by integrating real-time ocean data and high resolution models for public safety. This presentation will outline how Geographic Information Systems Specialists model the land and ocean from elevation datasets and how we combine digital products with ONC tsunami modellers.

**Webb Pinner** will talk about Sealog, an open-source event-logging system designed for research done with remote underwater vehicles. Events are cataloged with XYZ data (when available) and allow for GIS-replay. Webb has worked as a data engineer and marine tech for a variety of research and ocean exploration pursuits, contributing to a handful of other open-source projects including openVDM and openRVDAS.
