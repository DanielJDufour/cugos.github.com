## Agenda

- Dirck Schou and Kelly Malone from [Taqtile](http://taqtile.com/) will join us to discuss the state of the art, and talk about what can be done on these amazing new platforms. 
-"Local company Taqtile has been very active in the emerging technologies of augmented and virtual reality. As a finalist for Microsoft Public Sector Partner of the Year, Taqtile is one of the original members of the newly re-named Microsoft Mixed Reality Partner Program, and has been building applications for HoloLens, and other augmented and virtual reality (xR) platforms for over 2 years.  Taqtile's publicly available HoloMaps application for HoloLens, and the recently launched Manifest for knowledge capture, learning and doing platform, show the near future of digital transformation, and how mixed reality will impact many areas of the workplace."

- **[@you](http://cugos.org/people/)** tell us about what you're trying to solve.
