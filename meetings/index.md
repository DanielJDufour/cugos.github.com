CUGOS meetings are an opportunity to learn about open source geospatial software and to showcase your own projects. Typical meeting topics include [Open Street Map](http://www.openstreetmap.org/), [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/), [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com), and even quadcopters. All technical levels are welcome and we encourage everybody to share their interests with the group.

Meetings take place *the third Wednesday of every month at 6:00 PM*. The meeting location changes, but is updated promptly on individual meeting pages. Meetings last for approximately two hours and typically involve a post-meeting social at one of our local breweries or pubs.

If you're interested in speaking at CUGOS, feel free to drop us an email at *hello@cugos.org* or find us on IRC - **freenode** network, **#cugos** channel.
